# Some of my dotfiles. #
**It is always good to remember that:**

I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org "OS") as OS.
[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/ "Shell") for the shell (with [OMZ](https://ohmyz.sh/ "Shell framework") framework).

[Qtile](https://qtile.org/ "Desktop Enviroment") as DE.

[Lightdm](https://github.com/canonical/lightdm "Display manager") for display management.

And a little more, there are some dependencies, like:

## Fonts ##
[Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/ "Nerd fonts") specifically "Hack nerd font" & "Symbols nerd font", these are used on the DE for symbols and more.
[Hack fonts](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/ "Hack fonts") for vscode, terminal and everything that need an "easy read".

There are some fonts that are not listed because they are no fundamental for my UI. Those are "user picks".
